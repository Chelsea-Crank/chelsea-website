  ## About me

  I'm a visual designer based in Kitchener, Ontario. I'm a generalist and I wear many hats (luckily I'm a hat person).

  ### I design and build things from a user-centred approach.

  I love anything local and sustainable, and connecting with small businesses that have similar ethos.
